						<strong>About COVID-19</strong></a>
					</h2>
					<p class="post-contenido text-justify">
						COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. 
							To help stop the spread of coronavirus, you should only leave the house for 1 of 4 reasons:
								<b><ul> 
								<li>shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible </li>
								<li>one form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household </li>
								<li>any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person </li>
								<li>travelling to and from work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home </li> </ul></b>

						<strong>How are COVID-19 tests done</strong>
					</h2>
					<p class="post-contenido text-justify">
						The most common tests for COVID-19 involve taking a swab from a patient’s nose and throat and checking them for the genetic footprint of the virus. They are called “PCR tests”. The first PCR tests for COVID-19 were developed very rapidly – within two weeks of the disease being identified – and they are now part of the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s recommended protocol for dealing with the disease.

						<strong>United Kingdom situation</strong> 
					</h2>
					<p class="post-contenido text-justify">
						As of 9am on 30 March 2020, a total of 134,946 people have been tested, of which 112,805 were confirmed negative and 22,141 were confirmed positive.

						As of 5pm on 29 March 2020, 1,408 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.

						The figures for test results and for deaths are compiled from different sources. This is why the figures for deaths are reported from an earlier point in time than the figures for test results.
